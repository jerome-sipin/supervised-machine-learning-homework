This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the Supervised Machine Learning
homework.

For the analysis portions of this assignment, I have included them below.  

Prediction

I believe that the random forest will perform better because I don't really think
this data has a linear correlation. There are so many variables involved in This
dataset, so I don't think it's likely that the relationship between loan risk
and the other data is linear. Random forest models work better on non-linear data
as well, so I expect the results to be better from that model.


Analysis

As expected, the random forest model performed better than the logistic
regression model. It wasn't by a huge margin (only 0.04), but it's none-the-
less a better result.


Prediction (Scaled)

Scaling will probably improve the results. Since there were so many input
variables, putting them all on the same scale will likely lead to better
correlation between the input and output. The forest model will likely still
perform better than the logistic regression model.


Analysis (Scaled)

As expected, scaling the data improved the results. However, the logistic regression
performed better than the forest model this time. Perhaps with scaling, the dataset
became more linear in nature?
